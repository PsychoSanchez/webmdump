# webmdump
Project that was created in 1-2 days at weekend as a part of challange with my friend.
This repo contains website that build with meteor, uses client-side rendering and routing, cross-user reactivity and uses meteor as db.
So what is webmdump? Webmdum allows to upload and share small videos with format webm/mp4. 
It has main feed page that contains all videos, starting with newest ones. When new video is added every user sees it.
One of the main features is ability to roll random clips.
Also it has chat. But that not so important... NOTHING IS MORE IMPORTANT, THAN FUNNY SHORT VIDEOS WITH CATS.
